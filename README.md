# Company Employee Database

## Description
A database of a company's departments, roles, and employees that can be created/edited and viewed from the command line using prompted user input.

## Installation
Once the code is in your local files, run node index.js from the command line to begin the application.

## Usage
The primary function of this company employee database is to store information about a company, including which roles belong to which departments, which employees hold certain roles, what their salaries are, etc. When running the application, the user has 7 options to begin: view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employee role. Each add method allows the user to put new information into the database, while the update method allows them to edit which company role a given employee holds. The view methods will display a table in the command line with information about the selected company component (department, role, or employee).
